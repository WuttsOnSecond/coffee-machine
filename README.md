# coffee-machine
This is a Java command line project from Hyperskill: https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?goal=7

**About:** 
> What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple  of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
